We have changed from a Wizard/Build to a Repository so the system is more streamlined and efficient.

Home -> Submenu of NOVA Settings (Press left whilst hovering) 
-> File Manager -> Hold .NOVA BUILD -> Edit Source 
-> [B]Change[/B] http://novabuild.tk [B]to [COLOR aqua]http://archive.org/download/novarepo/[/COLOR][/B]

NEW REPO: [B]http://archive.org/download/novarepo/[/B]  !!

Once you have changed the repo location, install it from a zip file, then install addons from the repository.
